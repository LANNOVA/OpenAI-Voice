# OpenAI-Voice

Voice-activated chatbot with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a voice-activated chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It uses the Web Speech API to capture speech from the user, and sends the captured speech to OpenAI's API for processing. The response from the API is then spoken back to the user using the Web Speech API.

## Setup

To run this project, you'll need an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up for OpenAI at https://openai.com/signup/.

Once you have an API key, you'll need to replace the placeholder text `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your actual API key.

You can then open `index.html` in a web browser to start the chatbot.
